# Welcome to the source code for my website!

The goal of this repository is to create my personal website using node.js coupled with SvelteKit and some npm packages as opposed to my usual HTML/CSS/JS/PHP tech stack. If you see any places where I can make improvements, you are more than welcome to submit a pull request as I am a beginner muddling through.
